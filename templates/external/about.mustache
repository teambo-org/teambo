        <p>The best part about Teambo is that it's extensible. You can clone a fork and set up your
        own server to create whatever apps you want. It ships standard with a handful of
        useful apps, but the platform is open source. <!--You can find the source code for this
        very paragraph on <a href="https://github.com/teambo-org" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.--></p>

        <h3>Items and Planning</h3>
        <p>You can call them whatever you like. User Stories, Cards, Tickets, Bugs, Features, they
        are all Work Items. Whether you use Scrum, Kanban, Lean, or even Waterfall, defining work
        items and planning your work is an important part of team coordination. How you organize
        that work is up to you. Teambo allows you to define work items within folders
        and assign that work to a Plan.</p>

        </div></div>
        <link id="theme" type='text/css' rel='stylesheet'/>
        <p>You can call your plan a Sprint or a Release or a Milestone or a Board it's not
        important. All that matters is that you're signalling to your team that, "Hey, I'm going to
        do something about this work that needs to get done."</p>
