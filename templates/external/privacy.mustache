    <section class="privacy">
        This application was built for the sole purpose of providing the most secure collaboration possible. End-to-end encryption is built into every layer of the platform from the ground up to isolate and secure your data.<br>
        <br>
        This website will never store any form of personally identifiable information EXCEPT as necessary in reference to subscriptions and newsletters.<br>
        <br>
        Personally Identifiable Information<br>
        <br>
        Email Addresses, IP Addresses, and Geographic Data are just a few of the types of data this application will never record without explicit notice.<br>
        <br>
        Cookies<br>
        <br>
        This website does not use cookies.<br>
        <br>
        HTTPS<br>
        <br>
        All traffic to and from this application uses 2048-bit SSL certificates from <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a>.<br>
        <br>
        Browser Storage<br>
        <br>
        All content in browser local storage is stored encrypted. Sensitive information is stored in session storage.<br>
        <br>
        Email<br>
        <br>
        Emails are sent to users from the server through <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://sendgrid.com/">SendGrid</a>. Email address verification is a necessary step for proper authentication. No email you receive will ever contain information that can be used to definitively associate your email address with any specific account or team.<br>
        <br>
        Encryption Keys<br>
        <br>
        Shared encryption keys (such as those for teams) are created on the client side and shared between users with RSA. No server will ever have the ability to decrypt data stored in your account or team.<br>
        <br>
        Newsletter<br>
        <br>
        You may opt in to a periodic newsletter when creating your account to keep up to date on the state of the application. Volume should be approximately one email per month.<br>
